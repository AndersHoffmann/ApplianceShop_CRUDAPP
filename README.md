# Household Appliance Shop - CRUD App

Was given the task of creating a functional CRUD for a made-up appliance shop, using only a C# Console App, SqlClient and a simple MSSQL database. 

Worked out as expected - the following shows the general functionality of the App.

As an interesting addition, I started recreating part of the same App using the Blazor web framework, just to check out how Blazor worked. Quickly ended up with a small demonstration of the same functionality as the other App - using the same database.
